            <li><strong>PVC Mmembrane:</strong></li>
            PVC membrane is used mainly for waterproofing of tunnels, water reservoirs, residential and commercial buildings and industrial roofs. Since this material is quite easy to install, strong enough (is of great tensile strength), has long service life, all this puts the PVC membrane to a higher level comparing to bituminous roofing materials, especially considering that such materials need constant maintenance and repair.
          </p>
          <p  >Due to its structure, the PVC membrane is very strong and simultaneously flexible material which is resistant to precipitation, ultra-violet radiation, capable to withstand heavy surface and tensile loads. Normally the life cycle of PVC is 30 to 40 years.
          </p>
          <p  >
            <li><strong>TPO Membrane:</strong></li>
            There are many choices for TPO membranes. Only TPO offers excellent performance over &ldquo;standard&rdquo; TPO membranes and the industry's best guarantee: up to 35 years! Specifically, this patent-pending technology delivers next-generation performance against heat aging and UV degradation (the two key performance characteristics directly related to roof system longevity),and also exceeds all key ASTM standards for TPO membranes. Don&rsquo;t settle for standard TPO when you can get the advanced protection of TPO for your property.
          </p>
          <p >
            <li><strong>EPDM Membrane:</strong></li>
            Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer, commonly known, as EPDM was earlier developed as a substitute of natural rubber. But due to its superior performance in certain specific conditions like resistant to weather, climate, ageing, ozone, temperature &amp; ageing, it is now being preferred over natural rubber at areas which are more prone to such conditions. They are widely used all over the world for waterproofing application.EPDM Sheets are highly recommended for both indoor and outdoor use. it has an operating temperature range -30&deg;C to +120&deg;C. It is also suitable for insulation purposes and offers resistance to corrosive chemicals like acids, bases & mild solvents.
          </p>
          <p  >
            <li><strong>Polyurethane Membranes:</strong></li>
            Polyurethanes are liquid-applied, highly permanent elastic, cold applied / cold curing, one component / two component, polyurethane membrane used for long-lasting roof waterproofing. A solvent based, polyurethane roof waterproofing coating is based on pure elastomeric hydrophobic polyurethane resins. This unique method delivers superb mechanical, chemical, thermal, UV, and natural element resistance properties.
          </p>
          <p >
            <li><strong>PUMA Technology: </strong></li>
            PUMAunique waterproofing system based on a polyurethane modified methylmethacrylate. This combination assures that the finished system is rapidly ready for use and can also be applied during the winter period at a very low temperatures. The different products that make up the product cure to form a highly elastic foot trafficable waterproof system on old or new concrete, tiles, metal, wood, epoxy and methylmethacrylate existing deck coatings.

          <p >
            <li><strong>Polyurea:</strong></li>
            The latest coating technology is polyurea. Developed in the late 1980s for the automotive industry, this material is now used in a wide array of applications. Use of this material as industrial waterproofing has skyrocketed in popularity in the past decade due to its fast-curing, corrosion- and abrasion-resistant characteristics.</p>
          <p>Hybrid polyurea is also avilabe for the wateproofing treatment.</p>

            <li><strong>Crystalline WP System:</strong></li>
              Vandex invented crystalline waterproofing technology in 1943  founding a whole new industry and gaining Worldwide recognition for its performance and unparalleled high quality in waterproofing and protection. In 1943 the Danish chemist Lauritz Jensen patented the new crystalline active concrete waterproofing method. In 1946 he founded his first company and called it VANDEX (water out). Chemical reaction between hydration product of cement and crystalline active ingredients with resulting crystal formation in concrete. The crystalline system includes;</p>

            <ul >
            <li>Crystalline Coating: Cementitious crystalline slurry applied with brush/broom/spray system on concrete masonary.</li>
            <li>Crystalline Admix: Crystalline active reagent added during the concrete mixing plant or during the pouring.</li>
            <li>Crystalline Mortar: Crystalline active reagent added in cement mortar mix.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
          <li><strong> Conventional WP System:</strong></li>
            Lot of people even today use the conventional method of waterproofing. Few of them are common and being used in residential roofing, basements and wet areas. Brick bat Coba, Kota stone, acrylic polymeric cement slurry coating and grouting with non-shrink cement grout is common. However these system are depends on labour skills. These systems are not designed for the expansion contruction of building and very rigid in nature. Integral waterproofing compound used in cement mortar to fill the gaps.</p>
