        <p>
        The concept of waterproofing started with building construction activities in India. People in the very primitive age were aware of waterproofing.
          Activities:
        In India the Conventional Waterproofing methods were being used. Mudfuska &amp; clay were used in conventional waterproofing method. Bitumen uses of Waterproofing had a very long history.
        Why Bitumen accepted:
        Bitumen available in a cold state at room temperature on heating state bitumen becomes thin liquid which goes in pours and seals the substrate, which helps to stop the water seepage through substrate. Bitumen available in a cold state at room temperature, on heating state bitumen becomes thin liquid which goes in pours and seals the substrate which helps to stop the water seepage through substrate
        Draw backs of Bitumen:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Low Softening Point of 50 to 60<sup>0</sup>C</li>
            <li>Bitumen become soft in summer and it stats dripping through walls</li>
            <li>Cold flexibility in bitumen is not there , it start crack during cold weather.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        Hence there was the need of Bitumen with higher softening point which gives idea of Oxidizing Bitumen.
        Oxidized Bitumen Felt:
          Oxidized bitumen was being used for waterproofing purpose and later on the concept of reinforcing the Bitumen was developed with different layers of Oxidized Bitumen. Hessian cloth for reinforcement was used.This system was named as Hot mop system and it has been defined as Built-up roofing system. Tarfelt was first time introduced in India in 1956 later on the reinforcement was replaced by glass fabric and this has given the new waterproofing system as&rdquo; Tarfelt&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>The various treatment of Tarfelt Mop-up roofing is given below;</strong></p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Five course treatment.</li>
            <li>Seven course treatment.</li>
            <li>Nine course treatment.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        Thickness of Tarfelt membrane 1.0 mm -1.5 mm. Oxidized Membrane thickness up to 5.0 mm. But still the problem of cold flexibility remain as it. Although there was a slight improvement but still membrane were tends to crack even a temperature of 10<sup>0</sup>C. Moreover the 100<sup>0</sup>C softening point was not enough during peck hour andsurface temperature go beyond 80<sup>0</sup>C. This results in soften, melting bleeding of oxidized membrane.
        As time passes various products and modern construction techniques are implemented. Some of common products are used for waterproofing are given below;
